Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 3rd, 2025

Army of Towers is developed by Sebwestianflorley. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle user information when you use our app.

1. No Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or share any personal or non-personal data from users. Our game app operates entirely on-device and does not access any of the following:

Personal information (such as name, email, phone number)

Location data

Device identifiers

Contacts, camera, microphone, or other sensitive permissions

2. No Third-Party Services
Our app does not use third-party services that may collect data. This includes analytics tools, advertising networks, or other SDKs that process user information.

3. Children’s Privacy
Our app is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any data, compliance with children’s privacy laws such as COPPA is inherently met.

4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated date at the top.
